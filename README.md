# ALSU Verification UVM

This repository contains the complete UVM testbench and design files for verifying an **Arithmetic Logic and Shift Unit (ALSU)** module. Below is a breakdown of each file and its role in the verification architecture.

## üî∑ Introduction

This project presents a **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)** testbench for verifying an **Arithmetic Logic and Shift Unit (ALSU)**.

The ALSU performs a variety of arithmetic, logical, reduction, and shift operations on signed 3-bit operands `A` and `B`, and provides outputs including LEDs and a 6-bit signed result. The design includes control inputs for bypassing, reduction, and operation selection.

Our verification environment ensures comprehensive checking of functional correctness across all operation modes, including corner cases such as resets, bypasses, and serial input handling.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete UVM-based verification environment for an Arithmetic Logic and Shift Unit (ALSU). The verification testbench applies constrained random stimulus, functional coverage, and self-checking mechanisms to validate all supported operations, including arithmetic, logic, shift, and rotate functions. Using SystemVerilog and UVM methodology, the environment is modular and reusable, allowing easy extension to additional opcodes or configurations. The approach ensures thorough verification, detects corner-case scenarios, and increases confidence in the ALSU design correctness.
